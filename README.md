# Awesomium demo

This projectis a prototype of how you could get [Awesomium](http://awesomium.com/) working within directx.

# Requirements
- Visual Studio
- Windows
- Directx 9. I think this comes along with the latest windows 10 SDK.
- [Awesomium](http://awesomium.com/) installed using their sdk .exe setup.

# How to run
1. Install the [awesomium SDK](deps/awesomium_1_7_5_1_sdk_win.exe).
2. Run awesomium.sln in Visual Studio
3. Run it. Profit.
